> Building practical open source tools that improve developer workflows

## About

**Robert Allen** is a DevOps engineer, technologist and open source maintainer based in Farmville, Virginia. By day, he drives infrastructure automation at [HMH](https://www.hmhco.com/). By evening, he builds developer tools that solve real problems in technology and agriculture. And somehow also runs a [regenerative pasture farm](https://epicpastures.com/).

Creator of **[swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php)** (5K+ stars), the PHP library for generating OpenAPI documentation from annotations. Much appreciation to the community of contributors and users who have made it a success over the years.

### Focus Areas

- **Open Source Tooling** - Creating and maintaining tools that developers actually use
- **AI-Assisted Development** - Building Claude Code plugins, agents, and workflows
- **DevOps & Platform Engineering** - Infrastructure automation, CI/CD, AWS architecture
- **Architecture Documentation** - ADRs, decision tracking, knowledge capture

## Principles

1. **Developer Experience First** - Tools should reduce friction, not add it
2. **Automation Over Documentation** - Encode knowledge in code
3. **Open by Default** - Share solutions that might help others
4. **Practical Over Perfect** - Ship working software, iterate based on usage
