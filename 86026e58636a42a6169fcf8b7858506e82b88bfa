Rewrote README.md from personal voice instead of template voice
## Summary
Transformed the repository README from a generic template guide into a personal reference document for the zircote organization.

## Changes Made
- Changed title to `zircote/.github` with personal intro
- Removed template-oriented sections: "Setup for New Organizations", "Customization", generic "What This Repository Provides"
- Added "Tools & Plugins" section highlighting key projects (swagger-php, git-adr, etc.)
- Split "Related Repositories" into Templates and Tools
- Streamlined copy throughout - "my repositories" vs template language
- Kept technical reference sections (workflows, actions, labels) for actual use
