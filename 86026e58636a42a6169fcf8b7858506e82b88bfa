Rewrote README.md from personal voice instead of template voice
## Summary
Transformed the repository README from a generic template guide into a personal reference document for the zircote organization.

## Changes Made
- Changed title to `zircote/.github` with personal intro
- Removed template-oriented sections: "Setup for New Organizations", "Customization", generic "What This Repository Provides"
- Added "Tools & Plugins" section highlighting key projects (swagger-php, git-adr, etc.)
- Split "Related Repositories" into Templates and Tools
- Streamlined copy throughout - "my repositories" vs template language
- Kept technical reference sections (workflows, actions, labels) for actual use

Created ecosystem migration scripts using git-based sync strategy
## Summary
Built two complementary scripts for bringing the ecosystem to existing projects.

## Scripts Created
1. **migrate-project.sh** (19k) - One-time migration with file copy/merge
2. **sync-ecosystem.sh** (14k) - Git-based ongoing sync using subtree strategy

## Features
- Auto-detects project type (Python, TS, Go, Rust, Java)
- Applies universal files (pre-commit, gitleaks, issue templates, MCP config)
- Applies language-specific files (CI, CLAUDE.md, copilot-instructions)
- Interactive conflict resolution (overwrite/skip/diff/merge)
- Git remote tracking for ongoing updates
- Dry-run mode for safety
