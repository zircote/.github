# Personal GitHub Ecosystem

## Enterprise-Grade DevOps for Personal Projects

Allen Robel | 2025-12-29

::: notes
Welcome everyone. Today I'll be presenting the Personal GitHub Ecosystem framework -
bringing enterprise-grade DevOps practices to personal and small team projects.

# The Problem

## The Challenge

> "Every personal project starts with promise, but maintenance becomes a burden"

- Manual setup for each new project
- Inconsistent CI/CD configurations
- Security best practices often skipped
- Documentation becomes outdated
- No standardized tooling across projects

::: notes
How many of us have started personal projects with the best intentions, only to have them
fall into disrepair? The overhead of maintaining proper DevOps is often prohibitive.
